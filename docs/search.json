Over the centuries, I have dedicated my life to studying the history, languages, and cultures of the peoples of Middle-earth. On this website, I offer a glimpse into my vast body of knowledge, ongoing research, and publications.\nMy research interests span the entirety of Middle-earth, from the distant past to the present day. I am particularly passionate about the languages and mythologies of the Elves, Dwarves, and Men, and I have made significant contributions to the understanding of these subjects. My studies of the natural world have also been extensive, and I am an expert in the flora and fauna of Middle-earth. Additionally, I have been involved in many important historical events and offer valuable first-hand accounts and insights on the past.\nNot only am I a scholar, but I am also a mentor and teacher. Over the centuries, I have had the honor of working with many young wizards, passing on my knowledge and experience to the next generation. I have a particular interest in the education of hobbits, whom I see as having great potential despite their small size and simple lifestyle. My teaching style is engaging and accessible, and I encourage my students to think critically and creatively.\nOn this website, you will find a selection of my published works, including scholarly articles, monographs, and translations. You will also find news and updates on my current research projects, as well as information on upcoming events and conferences where I will be speaking. I invite you to explore my website and learn more about my life’s work as one of Middle-earth’s greatest scholars and thinkers."

My goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the cultures and histories of these peoples by studying their languages. Currently, I am working on a monograph that explores the linguistic roots of the Elvish languages. Through extensive research and analysis, I hope to shed light on the connections between the different dialects of Elvish and their origins. This project has been particularly challenging, as Elvish is a complex and nuanced language, but I am determined to see it through to completion."

    "text": "Quarto ‘quick and dirty’ or {Golem} for longevity and complexity?\nAs expected in an open-source programming language, the app-making landscape in R seems to be in constant flux. Something newish that I’ve been finding useful lately is using Quarto’s ‘Dashboards with Shiny for R’ feature.\nQuarto is very similar to Rmarkdown, but has a few additional features. One of them is the ability to embed R {shiny} apps. So you end up writing your app like you would a markdown doc - the context, ui, and server are all code chunks, and the text around those code chunks set’s up the UI. For example, normally in markdown we use # to delineate and navigate headers; in Quarto Shiny Dashboards, # are used to delineate pages, tab panels, etc.\nI’ve found it’s great for proto-typing simple apps - you can get something up and running very quickly in Quarto’s ‘Dashboards with Shiny for R’. However, I think it could get unwieldy when you start building complex apps with modules etc. In that case, developing your {shiny} app as an R package with {golem} might be a better option. {golem} provides a great framework for engineering production grade shiny apps that are complex and can be easily maintained in the long-term.\nI ended up turning the prototype app I built in Quarto’s ‘Dashboards with Shiny for R’ into an R package with {golem}. It took much longer than I expected, but much of that time was learning about R package development (which I had never done before) and {golem}.\nIn the end I think it was worth the extra time and effort streamline as an R package. But if you want to compare for yourself, find the protoype Quarto dashboard shiny here and the {golem} R package version here.\nCurious to hear others’ experiences though - please get in touch."
